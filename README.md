AllTheLinks is a World of Warcraft addon that gives you easy access to all the links to ranking websites
of players you come across in the game: Wow Armory, Check-PvP, Raider.io, Warcraft Logs, WoWProgress...

It's only available on retail.

## Example

## Error when opening a link?

Most websites (raider.io, check pvp) only scan a player if requested, so if you use a link to a player that has never been scanned before, his profile won't exist!

You'll have to manually search for that player, and then the link will work for everyone :)

If it still doesn't work after that, the realm name may cause a problem, feel free to tell me in the comments or open an issue.

## Missing a link?

Feel free to ask for other websites if I missed any of the big ones :) (although I don't guarantee I'll add it)

## Added a new language to support?

If you want your addon in your language you can open an issue / a PR. Otherwise, a "Localization" tab is available on Curse to translate. If you do, don't hesitate to ping me in the comments (I don't get notifications when new translations are added, and I sometimes forget to check).
